How to use this Guide.



This Guide is intended as a concise description of different levels of Army leadership competencies and attributes. Pages 2 and 3 present the Army Leadership Requirements Model from leadership doctrine (ADP 6-22 and ADRP 6-22) and a short description of the three categories of leadership competencies and three categories of leader attributes.



Page 3 of this Guide also provides short pointers about how a rater prepares to observe a subordinate leader’s performance.



Pages 4 through 14 provide examples of what each of the ten leadership competencies look like and what each of the thirteen attributes look like. For each of the ten and thirteen an example is given of what performance looks like in the categories of developmental need, standard and strength. The three categories are ordered in terms of what can be expected from novice to seasoned performer to expert. These examples are NOT to be used as excerpts for formal performance appraisals and only serve as a guide in differentiating the level of performance.



Pages 15 through 22 reproduce the detailed tables from ADRP 6-22 that show example behaviors related to leadership competencies and attributes. These behaviors are what a leader is expected to do or to demonstrate. In comparison, the descriptions of developmental need, standard, and strength on pages 4-14 are how well a leader performs in relation to these expectations. The ADRP 6-22 tables provide expanded information on doctrinal requirements than what is contained on DA Form 67-10-1, Part IV.



Page 23 of this Guide provides a brief summary of what result the ten leadership competencies should have. It also shows how performance can vary along four levels of performance. The four categories differentiating performance are based on a combination of: a) the extent of demonstration of a desired behavior, b) the ability and initiative shown in learning to improve or engage in a desired behavior, and c) the extent and duration of impact that the behavior has on self, others or unit performance.



The examples of the level of competencies and attributes were drawn from a related publication (Developing Leadership During Unit Training Exercises) that was produced to be an observation guide for trainers, mentors, observer/controllers. Refer to that guide and other leadership products (see CAL webpage http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/CAL/) to learn more about the processes of creating a climate for development, observing leadership, delivering feedback for impact, guiding learning and development, and taking steps to improve leadership.







Army Leadership Requirements Model





Understanding the competencies and attributes in the Army Leadership Requirements Model is essential to make careful and accurate observations of a subordinate’s performance and potential.

The core leader competencies include how Army leaders lead people; develop themselves, their subordinates, and organizations; and achieve the mission. The competencies are the most outwardly visible signs of a leader’s performance.

Leader attributes are inward characteristics of the individual that shape the motivations for actions and bearing, and how thinking affects decisions and interactions with others.

Accurate, Descriptive Observations

Observing leadership is accomplished by watching how a leader interacts with others and influences them. Written directives, verbal communications, and leader actions all provide indications of how a leader performs. Raters also learn about their subordinates’ leadership by observing for reactions to the subordinate among peers, subordinates, and other superiors.

When observing leadership, the following three key components ensure observations are accurate and descriptive:

Plan ahead to take multiple observations during the rating period. Use both key events and routine operations.

Make observations based on the leadership requirements model (ADRP 6-22) and the individual’s duty descriptions and performance objectives. Look for a pattern of behavior. Seek to confirm initial impressions. Be alert for changes in performance and causes for strengths, inconsistencies, or weaknesses.

Record important observations immediately for later use in performance and professional growth counseling and for the OER.
